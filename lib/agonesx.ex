  The SDKs are relatively thin wrappers around gRPC generated clients.

  They connect to a small process that Agones coordinates to run alongside the
  Game Server in a Kubernetes Pod. This means that more languages can be
  supported in the future with minimal effort.

  There is also local development tooling for working against the SDK locally,
  without having to spin up an entire Kubernetes infrastructure.

  Calling any of state changing functions mentioned below does not guarantee
  that GameServer Custom Resource object would actually change its state right
  after the call. For instance, it could be moved to the Shutdown state
  elsewhere (for example, when a fleet scales down), which leads to no changes
  in GameServer object. You can verify the result of this call by waiting for
  the desired state in a callback to watch_game_server() function.

  With some matchmakers and game matching strategies, it can be important for
  game servers to mark themselves as Allocated. For those scenarios, this SDK
  functionality exists.

  There is a chance that GameServer does not actually become Allocated after
  this call. Please refer to the general note in Function Reference above.

  This tells Agones that the Game Server is ready to take player connections.
  Once a Game Server has specified that it is Ready, then the Kubernetes
  GameServer record will be moved to the Ready state, and the details for its
  public address and connection port will be populated.

  While Agones prefers that shutdown() is run once a game has completed to
  delete the GameServer instance, if you want or need to move an Allocated
  GameServer back to Ready to be reused, you can call this SDK method again to
  do this.

  This tells Agones to shut down the currently running game server. The
  GameServer state will be set Shutdown and the backing Pod will be deleted, if
  they have not shut themselves down already.

  With some matchmaking scenarios and systems it is important to be able to
  ensure that a GameServer is unable to be deleted, but doesn’t trigger a
  FleetAutoscaler scale up. This is where reserve(seconds) is useful.

  reserve(seconds) will move the GameServer into the Reserved state for the
  specified number of seconds, and then it will be moved back to
  Ready state. While in Reserved state, the GameServer will not be deleted on
  scale down or Fleet update, and also it could not be Allocated using
  GameServerAllocation.

  This is often used when a game server process must register itself with an
  external system, such as a matchmaker, that requires it to designate itself as
  available for a game session for a certain period. Once a game session has
  started, it should call allocate() to designate that players are currently
  active on it.

  Calling other state changing SDK commands such as ready or allocate will turn
  off the timer to reset the GameServer back to the Ready state or to promote it
  to an Allocated state accordingly.
